# Variant Mapping Application: Customize and Annotate Figures of Sodium and Potassium Ion Channels

Voltage-gated sodium ion channels allow for the initiation and transmission of action potentials. There is a high interest in research and drug development to selectively target these ion channels to treat epilepsy and other disorders such as pain. Scientific literature and presentations often incorporate maps of these integral membrane proteins with markers indicating gene mutations to highlight genotype/phenotype correlations. There is a need for automated tools to create high quality figures with mutation (variant) locations displayed on these channel maps. This manuscript introduces a simple application to create visualization for mutations on alpha voltage-gated sodium channels, created using the D3.js library. The application allows for mapping of variant sequences, as well as important properties like the type of variant and the phenotypes linked to the variant. It also allows for customizability and the production of high-quality images for publication. This application and code base can further be extrapolated to other ion channels as well.
